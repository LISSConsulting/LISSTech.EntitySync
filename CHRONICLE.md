## Current Focus

- Implementing specs/001-lcat-sync-adapter/tasks.md. T001 (Setup) done: created
  `src/Adapters/LCAT/` with `LCATOptions.cs` and a placeholder `LCATEntityAdapter.cs`
  implementing `IEntityAdapter`. Create/Update are final (`NotSupportedException`,
  batch-only per spec); `GetEntitiesAsync`/`TestConnectionAsync` are `NotImplementedException`
  stubs pending T019. Next incomplete task: T002.
